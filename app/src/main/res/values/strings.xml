        Enabling this would unlock the following in UltraFocus:\n1. App Blocking\n2, Focus Mode \n\n
        UltraFocus needs access to accessibility data to know when you open a specific feature within an app, like a social media feed or a game.
        This lets UltraFocus block those features for you based on your preferences, helping you stay focused and reduce screen distractions.\n\n
        Rest assured, all accessibility data stays securely on your deviceâ€”we never share or transmit your data, ensuring your privacy is always protected.
